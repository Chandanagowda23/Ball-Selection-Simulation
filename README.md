# Ball Selection Simulation

## Project Description
This project simulates different methods of selecting balls from a bowl and analyzes the probability of choosing a white ball. The methods vary in terms of ball painting strategies and the friend's selection process.

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `code/` directory.
4. Run the MATLAB scripts for Method A, Method B, and Method C simulations:
    - `method_A_simulation.m`
    - `method_B_simulation.m`
    - `method_C_simulation.m`
